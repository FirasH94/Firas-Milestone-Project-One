# Personal Portfolio

Personal portfolio is a web app that I created which focuses on providing recruiters/company employers some personal information about me as well as granting them the background knowledge regarding the history of my academic years as well as my job careers.

Furthermore, through this web app, the recruiters/employers will be able to learn about the variety of programming skills which I possess and aid them in offering me a job which suits my experience and career qualities.

This web app was also created to provide other individuals with a similar career path an idea of how a developer’s personal profile should look like as well their CV.


### Developer goals:

-	To sell myself when trying to pursue my career in software development as well as web development.
-	To create a clean and comfortable navigation system through the website for the user to surf without a lot of effort.
-	To provide the user with a contact method which enables them to get in touch with me for any opportunities.

### User goals and interests:


- 	To understand some background information about the individual which the portfolio belongs to.
-	Being able to access the individual’s CV for their career history.
-	Being able to see what different skills they possess and how experienced they are with them.
-	Being able to get in touch with the individual for more information/interviews.




## UX

**Target users:**

As briefly mentioned, the target website users are Company employers that are looking to recruit software developers as well as web developers to pursue a career or hire them as a temporary contract job. 
Another target user is a recruiter which is looking for an ideal individual to discuss a potential job/future career.


**This application was developed for the following stories:**


-	As a user type, I want to find out the variety of skills a developer possesses.
-	As a user type, I want to find out what degree an individual does to have a career in development.
-	As a user type, I want to use this web app to see what a CV of a developer looks like.
-	As a user type, I want to be able to get in touch with the developer to discuss future careers or possible opportunities and potentially hire them.
-	As a user type, I want to see how a web app is presented for a personal portfolio.

This web app was designed to be responsive on all available platforms such as desktop, tablet and mobile phones.



**Wireframes**


The user can view the initial wireframes design for this web app by downloading the following [PDF document](https://pdfhost.io/v/tKbBzz6m_Wireframespdf.pdf).

## Features



**Navigation around the site:**

The website consists of four different sections: About section, Experience section, Skills section and Contact section. 
The navigation section sticks on the web app meaning that it will always be visible no matter where you are on the website. 
This allows ease of navigation around the website when wanting to move around different sections instantly.

The website also contains a “back to top” button located on the bottom right hand side of the website. When clicked, this will automatically take the user to the first section of the website (The introduction section).

The navigation bar changes into a toggler when viewed on a smaller sized screen such as mobile phone. 
When the screen size is shrinks, the “Menu” button appears which then can be clickable to display a dropdown menu that enables the navigation through the app.


**About Section:**

The about section is the first main section of the web app. This will provide the reader some background information about myself and my academic background. 
This section also provides a short summary regarding my hobbies and what I enjoy doing outside my professional career.

This section also contains a small collage of personal images which refers to my hobbies part of the content. When viewed on a mobile device, these images become hidden as they take a large amount of space when displayed in blocks.
Hiding them also presents a better user experience when viewing the web app.


**Experience section:**


In this section, I have listed my career history providing information about my past work experience as well as my present job role.

In my experience segment there are sub sections which each contain the job role that I worked as along with the timeline of my job. 
Within the sub-section, I have also provided key points for the job summary explaining my job role as well as the key objectives. 
If the reader is interested in finding out more information, they can click on the “Read more” collapsible. This will expand another sub section which provides more content about my objectives/key roles. 

These features are all responsive within the web app and can enlarge/shrink in a suitable matter to meet the right user experience needs depending on the size of the screen. 
For instance, when the experience section is viewed on a mobile screen, the Career info is moved under the title displaying in blocks for a cleaner layout.


**Skills section:**

For this section, I have listed out my technical programming skills. This is mainly for the Recruiters/company employers to look at and see if I am suitable or not for a specific job role or a potential career.

For each skill I have implemented some sort of a progress bar. This bar is used to show how experienced I am in that specific skill. Looking at the progress bars as you can see, my top two skills are HTML/HTML5 and CSS. 

Furthermore, I have implemented a collapsible to provide a short summary about my experience with that skill for better understanding.


**Contact section:**

The contact section consists of a form which can be used for the user to get in touch with me directly. This can be for the cause of a job opportunity or generic questions regarding my career.

**The footer:**

The footer contains a download button for my personal CV. This way other individuals can benefit by getting ideas of how a developer’s CV should look like an assist them in refining theirs. 
On the other hand, the primary reason I have enabled the download CV function is to allow the recruiters/employers to view my skillset properly and get in touch if they think that I can fit in a role.

The footer also includes links to all my social media pages. In case they want to get in touch through different platforms or view my profile. There is also a disclaimer for copyright at the very bottom of the web app.



**Features to implement in the future:**

-	Setting the contact page to send an automated email to the recipient once they submit a successful message delivered to me. This way they receive a confirmation that I did receive their email and will get in touch as soon as possible.
-	Expand my knowledge in the IT industry and add the extra information on the web app for more exposure to companies.
-	Add a projects section which shows/redirects website users to my personal projects which I have implemented during my career.


## Technologies used 

In this section, you should mention all the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

-	HTML/HTML5 – This was used to implement most of the content on the site.
-	CSS – This was used for the design/look and feel of the site.
-	Git – Used as a repository and to host my web app.
-	Cloud 9 – This is the platform used for developing the web app.
-	Font awesome – This was used mainly for navigation purposes and to aid in making the web app responsive.
-	JavaScript – This was used for minor functionality such as on page load modal and the contact form submit.


## Testing

### Generic/Journey testing:

The following have been tested from a user’s perspective to ensure the web app works as expected:

-	Easy to navigate around the web app as the navigation link/drop-down menu is easily visible no matter where you are on the web app.
-	Each section of the web app easily recognisable easy to read/understand.
-	Easily detect which sub-section the user is reading as they hover on each career timeline under the experience page.
-	Shows clear understanding to the user that this is a personal portfolio web app.
-	The user can easily indicate how experienced I am in each programming skill as the progress bar is displayed clearly.
-	The user can easily access my CV as the download button is large and clear.
-	The user can easily contact me through the contact form as it is simple and intuitive.
-	The user can go back at the top of the web app by clicking the back to top button.
-	The user is easily able to read all web app content as the font is large and clear.


### Manual Testing

-	Navigation links:
	Each navigation link has been tested to ensure that it is linked to the correct section of the web app. The navigation link has also been tested when viewed on a smaller screen sizes to ensure the functionality is consistent making sure the toggler is activated correctly.
-	Read more buttons:
	Each read more button has been tested to make sure that it expands when clicked and collapses when clicked again. These buttons have also been tested to make sure that they are linked separately and clicking each one doesn’t cause another collapsible to expand.
-	Programming language buttons (Under skills section):
	This scenario has been tested the same way as the read more buttons. They have been tested to make sure they expand and collapse with no issues/bugs. These have also been tested to make sure they are linked separately.
-	On page load welcome modal:
	This modal appears as a welcome message when the web app loads for the user successfully. This was tested to make sure that it appears every time the web app is loaded.
-	Contact form:
	Each field was tested thoroughly to make sure that the mandatory functionality worked. I have tested the following fields: Full name, email address, Phone and comments section. The form has failed to submit if any of the fields was left blank. I have also tested that the modal window pops up confirming that the form has been submitted when processed successfully.
	The email address field has also been tested when trying to insert an invalid email address. The form fails to submit as the email address is not written in the correct format.
	The phone number field has also been tested to make sure that it only allows numeric values and no other character.
-	Social media icons:
	The social media icons in the footer section have all been tested to make sure they are linked correctly and work fine. The “_blank” attribute have also been tested on all of them to make sure that when they are clicked, a new window is open rather than navigating away from the web app.
-	Buttons hover:
	All buttons with the hover effect have been tested across the web app. The functionality was working correctly and each button changes colour when hovered over.

All images have been tested to make sure they change size when resizing the screen. Background images were tested to make sure that they are covering each section no matter what the screen size is.

The web app content was checked and tested to make sure that there was no Grammarly error.




### Cross browser/device testing:

**iPad:**

-	Safari: The web app has been tested to make sure all sections are appearing correctly on iPad making sure the media queries are working as expected. This has been tested as landscape as well as portrait.

-	Chrome: The web app has also been tested on the chrome browser making sure it is displayed consistently a long with Safari on the iPad device.


**Desktop:**

-	Chrome: Testing was done to make sure all images/content was displayed clearly on the large desktop screen.

-	Firefox: Testing was also carried on Firefox to make sure everything is consistent with chrome.


**Android phone:**

-	Android internet: Tested mainly to make sure the web app is responsive correctly on small screen sizes. This was tested through landscape and portrait orientation.

-	Chrome: The web app was also tested on chrome mainly for orientation purposes.


### Issues found and resolved:

The main testing was done throughout carrying the project which means that almost all issues were fixed the implementation carried forward.

The container that has the “Downlaod CV” button was showing the shadow effect that was implemented on the sub-sections under the “Experience” page when hovered over. 
This was not supposed to happen but was fixed during implementation. There was a class which connected both sections together that I removed then that fixed it.

There was Grammarly error in the content under “Implementation Specialist At MaritzCX Jan 18 – Present”. This was fixed during implementation.

Each section header was not consistent in terms of responsiveness with the content section when the screen size changes. This was fixed by applying the same sizing classes for all containers.



### Left to resolve:

When scrolling through “About me” section, sometimes the “Back to top” button becomes unclickable. This would need to be fixed in the future.

There is a slight extra margin/padding that goes across the whole web app when viewed on any device/browser which needs to be fixed in the future.



## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE, this was then committed to git and pushed to GitHub through the terminal within Cloud9.

To deploy the project from the GitHub repository to GitHub Pages I took the following steps:

1.	Logged into GitHub.
2.	Chose Firas-Milestone-Project-One from the list of repositories.
3.	Selected Settings from the menu that is just under the respository, it is the last item on the right.
4.	Scrolled down to the section titled GitHib Pages.
5.	Under Source clicked the dropdown menu titled None and selected Master Branch.
6.	This automatically refreshes the page which took me back to the top. The website has now been delpoyed.
7.	Then I scrolled back down to the GitHub Pages section where there is now a link to the delpoyed website, I clicked the link to view and check it.

Please note - On submission the The Development Branch and Master Branch of this project are identical.

The submission URL to the Final version of the website is: https://firash94.github.io/Firas-Milestone-Project-One/
